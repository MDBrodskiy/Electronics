\begin{itemize}

  \item Silicon Diodes

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Applications

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Rectifiers (AC-to-DC converters)

          \item Overvoltage protection circuits

          \item Signal processing

        \end{itemize}

      \item Small-signal silicon diodes

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Low and medium power applications

          \item Discrete components (in lab)

        \end{itemize}

      \item Circuit symbol: a triangle (positive side, anode), with a vertical line through the point (negative side, cathode)

      \item Diodes dissipate power

    \end{itemize}

  \item Ideal Diode Model

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Rough approximation

        \begin{itemize}

          \item For quick and intuitive circuit analysis

          \item Idealized transfer characteristic (without forward voltage drop and reverse breakdown)

        \end{itemize}

      \item In the reverse bias region, $V<0\to i=0$, while, in the forward bias region, $i>0\to V=0$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Analysis Using the Ideal Diode Model

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Assume each diode is either open/reverse-biased (RB) or short/forward-biased (FB)

      \item Redraw the circuit while replacing all assumed RB diodes with open-circuits and all FB diodes with short-circuit

      \item Following conventional circuit analysis, solve for:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Voltages across RB diodes $\to$ verify $V_d<0$

          \item Currents through FB diodes $\to$ verify $i_d>0$

        \end{itemize}

      \item If all assumptions are correct, then the analysis is complete. If any of the RB/FB conditions are not met, proceed with step 1 by making different assumptions for diodes.

    \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
