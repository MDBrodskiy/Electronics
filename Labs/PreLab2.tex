  \item

    Using the equation:

    $$i=I_s\left( e^{v/(nV_T)}-1 \right)$$

    and the given measurements, we may write:

    $$10^{-3}=I_s\left( e^{.62/(n.025)}-1 \right)$$
    $$10^{-2}=I_s\left( e^{.69/(n.025)}-1 \right)$$

    Since the exponential is greater than 1, we may simplify to:

    $$\frac{10^{-3}}{e^{24.8/n}}=I_s$$
    $$\frac{10^{-2}}{e^{27.6/n}}=I_s$$

    $$I_s=.001e^{-\frac{24.8}{n}}$$
    $$I_s=.01e^{-\frac{27.6}{n}}$$

    We can combine the two equations to solve for $n$ and $I_s$:

    $$.001e^{-\frac{24.8}{n}}=.01e^{-\frac{27.6}{n}}$$
    $$e^{-\frac{24.8}{n}}=10e^{-\frac{27.6}{n}}$$
    $$e^{\frac{27.6-24.8}{n}}=10$$
    $$\frac{27.6-24.8}{n}=\ln(10)$$
    $$n=\frac{2.8}{\ln(10)}$$
    $$\boxed{n=1.216}$$

    We then plug this into the earlier equations to find $I_s$:

    $$I_s=.001e^{-24.8/1.216}$$
    $$\boxed{I_s=1.3889\cdot10^{-12}[\si{\ampere}]}$$

    We can verify by using the second equation for $I_s$:

    $$I_s=.01e^{-27.6/1.216}$$
    $$\boxed{I_s=1.3889\cdot10^{-12}[\si{\ampere}]}$$

    It is difficult to measure the current in a reverse bias mode, however, because the diode may reach breakdown voltage by increasing the reverse voltage.

  \item Read through, no questions \textcolor{green}{\checkmark}

  \item Taking the forward voltage of the LEDs as $.2[\si{\volt}]$, and the input as $8[\si{\volt}]$, we can make some relevant calculations, assuming each LED will form a ``branch'' consisting of a resistor and the LED itself. First, using the maximum power, we can calculate the maximum current, starting with the first (red) LED to turn on:

    $$I_{max}=\frac{6\cdot10^{-2}}{.2}=.3[\si{\ampere}]$$

    Now, we find the resistance value:

    $$R_{red}=\frac{8-.2}{.3}=26[\si{\ohm}]$$

    We then cascade this with the next LED to turn on (yellow), and calculate (using the Zener rating):

    $$I_{max}^2=\frac{1}{8}=.125[\si{\amp}]$$

    Summing this with the current flowing through $R_{red}$, we get:

    $$I_{yel}=.425[\si{\amp}]$$

    From which we derive a resistor value:

    $$R_{yel}=\frac{17-8}{.425}=21.176[\si{\ohm}]$$

    Repeating a similar process for green, we find:

    $$R_{grn}=\frac{24-8}{.425}=37.647[\si{\ohm}]$$

    We combine the cascade, along with a $26[\si{\ohm}]$ series resistor to get:

    This, however, is not the final step, as we need to add an additional diode in tandem with a resistor to maintain a safe operating range for the LEDs. Thus, our final circuit becomes:
