\begin{enumerate}

  \item We may begin by performing a DC analysis of the circuit. As a result, we may see that $I_D$ and $V_{DS}$ need to be calculated. Assuming performance in the saturation region (since this is preferred for amplification), we may write:

    $$I_D=\frac{1}{2}\mu_n\cos\left( \frac{w}{L} \right)\left( V_{GS}-V_{t} \right)^2$$

    We can substitute in known values to obtain:

    $$I_D=\frac{1}{2}\left( .25\cdot10^{-3} \right)\left( 2-1 \right)^2$$
    $$\boxed{I_D=.125[\si{\milli\ampere}]}$$

    From this, we may write:

    $$-V_{DD}+R_DI_D+V_D=0$$
    $$V_D=V_{DD}-R_DI_D$$

    We now substitute known values to get:

    $$V_D=(10)-(10k)(.125m)$$
    $$\boxed{V_D=8.75[\si{\volt}]}$$

    To confirm saturation conditions, we get:

    $$V_{DS}\geq V_{GS}-V_t$$

    $$V_{DS}=V_{DD}-V_{D}$$
    $$V_{DS}=10-8.75$$
    $$\boxed{V_{DS}=1.25[\si{\volt}]}$$

    Since $1.25\geq 1$, we may conclude that we are, as a matter of fact, operating in saturation. We may proceed to calculation of a Th\'evenin equivalent:

    $$V_{th}=V_{DD}\left( \frac{R_{G2}}{R_{G1}+R_{G2}} \right)$$
    $$R_{th}=\left( \frac{R_{G1}R_{G2}}{R_{G1}+R_{G2}} \right)$$
    $$R_{th}=\left( \frac{R_{G1}R_{G2}}{R_{G1}+R_{G2}} \right)$$

    To find the correct values, we use KVL to write:

    $$-V_{DD}+I_DR_D+V_{DS}+V_{S}=0$$

    This lets us find $V_{S}$:

    $$V_{S}=10-8.75-1.25$$
    $$V_{S}=0[\si{\volt}]$$

    Since we know the value of $V_{GS}$, we write:

    $$V_{GS}=V_G-V_S$$
    $$2=V_G-V_S$$

    Thus, we find that $V_G=V_{th}=2[\si{\volt}]$. We may then write:

    $$2=\frac{10R_{G2}}{R_{G1}+R_{G2}}$$
    $$R_{G1}+R_{G2}=5R_{G2}$$
    $$R_{G1}=4R_{G2}$$

    We can take any values for which the above statement is true. As such, let us use:

    $$\boxed{R_{G1}=4[\si{\mega\ohm}]\quad\text{ and }R_{G2}=1[\si{\mega\ohm}]}$$

  \item We may combine some CD4007s to obtain (Note A, B, and C are the push-button inputs):
