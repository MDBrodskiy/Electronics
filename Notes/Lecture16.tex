\begin{itemize}

  \item CMOS Inverter

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Only dissipates dynamic power during switching

        \begin{itemize}

          \item No static power consumption (same applies to other CMOS gates)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Series connected transistors become ``or-ed'' and parallel connected transistors become ``and-ed''

  \item De Morgan's Laws

    \begin{itemize}

      \item For a given boolean expression, an equivalent expression can be formed by performing all of the following steps

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Replacing all variables by their inverses

          \item Replacing AND operations by OR operations (or vice versa)

          \item Inverting the complete expression

        \end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
