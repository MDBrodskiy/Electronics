\begin{itemize}

  \item General Amplifier Analysis Procedure

    \begin{itemize}

      \item DC bias circuit analysis/design

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Consider only DC sources (remove AC sources)

          \item Ensure operation in the active region

          \item Take desired Q-point parameters into account ($g_m$, $r_\pi$, etc.)

        \end{itemize}

      \item AC Analysis

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Draw the AC equivalent circuit with the appropriate BJT model

          \item Consider only AC sources (remove DC sources)

          \item Midband (medium-frequency AC analysis):

              \begin{itemize}

                \item Capacitor $\to$ short-circuit, inductor $\to$ open-circuit

              \end{itemize}

            \item Frequency-dependent analysis

              \begin{itemize}

                \item Capacitor and inductor go to their frequency-dependent impedances

              \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item Removal of Sources

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Voltage source $\to$ replace with a short-circuit

          \item Current source $\to$ replace with an open-circuit

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
