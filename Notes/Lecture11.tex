\begin{itemize}

  \item npn Bipolar Junction Transistors

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The collector ``collects'' electrons, and causes current to flow through the emitter

    \end{itemize}
    
  \item npn Structure without Bias

    \begin{itemize}

      \item At zero bias ($V_{be}=V_{bc}=0$), neither electrons nor holes can overcome this built-in voltage barrier of $\approx.7[\si{\volt}]$ (for Si)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $I_B=I_C=0$ (cutoff)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item npn Structure with Forward-Biased EBJ

    \begin{itemize}

      \item When ($V_{be}=.65[\si{\volt}]$, $V_c>V_b$), electrons and holes can overcome the built-in voltage barrier between the base and emitter

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $I_b>0$ and $I_e>I_b$ (due to $n^+$ emitter doping)

        \end{itemize}

      \item If the base region is very thin, the electrons injected by the emitter are collected by the positive voltage applied at $V_c$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $I_c\approx I_E >> I_B$ (active region)

        \end{itemize}

      \item If the base region is too thick, many electrons injected at the emitter are lost by recombining with holes in the base before the voltage applied at $V_c$ can collect them

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $I_c<I_E$ (active region with low $\alpha$ and $\beta\to$ low gain)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Achievement of high $\beta$ during Fabrication

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Thin base region

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Increases the collection efficiency for injected electrons

          \item Reduces the chance of electron recombination in the base

        \end{itemize}

      \item Heavily-doped emitter

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $I_E/I_B\propto n (\text{emitter})/ p (\text{base})\propto \beta$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Doping concentrations are difficult to control precisely

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Current gain is not uniform among BJTs (exception: when the BJTs are all fabricated on the same integrated circuit $\to$ small variations)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Early Effect

    \begin{itemize}

      \item As $V_c$ increases, the depletion width of the B-C junction widens

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Base width becomes more narrow

          \item Increased collection efficiency

          \item Finally, $I_c/I_b$ increases (higher $\beta$)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
