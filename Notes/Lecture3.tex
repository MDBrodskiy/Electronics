\begin{itemize}

  \item Frequency Dependence (Impedance)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Capacitor

        $$Z_c=\frac{1}{j\omega C}$$

      \item Inductors

        $$Z_L=j\omega L=SL$$

      \item Note, for capacitors impedance decreases with frequency, while it increases with frequency for inductors

    \end{itemize}

  \item DC Coupling
    
    \begin{itemize}

      \item Amplifier stages are directly connected together

      \item High-frequency gain decreases (``rolls off'') due to unwanted (``parasitic'') capacitances and inductances

    \end{itemize}

  \item AC Coupling

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Input-coupling capacitors are sometimes referred to as DC-blocking Capacitors

      \item Improved isolation between stages because the capacitors ``block'' DC current/voltages ($Z_c=1/j\omega C\to$ infinite impedance at $\omega=0$)

      \item Impacts the low-frequency response

    \end{itemize}

  \item Impact of Parasitics (Stray Inductances/Capacitances)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Stray inductances/capacitances (often called ``parasitics'') result from non-ideal properties of materials:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Integrated circuits, chip packages, printed circuit boards, cables, \ldots

        \end{itemize}

      \item High-frequency gain reduction from:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Capacitors in parallel with the signal path

          \item Inductors in series with the signal path

        \end{itemize}

      \item Computer-based simulations are used for complex models and circuits

    \end{itemize}

  \item Half-Power Bandwidth

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $P_o=(AV_{\text{inRMS}})^2/R_L\to P_o=P_{max}/2\text{ when} A=A_{max}/\sqrt{2}$

      \item By convention, the frequencies $f_H$ and $f_L$ at which $P_o=P_{max}/2$ are referred to as half-power frequencies or $-3\text{db}$ frequencies

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Note: $20\log(A_{max}/\sqrt{2})=20\log(A_{max})-20\log(\sqrt{2})=A_{max\text{(dB)}}-3.01\text{dB}$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Amplifier bandwidth: $B=f_H-f_L$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
