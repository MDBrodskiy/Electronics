\begin{itemize}

  \item Integrators

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Capacitor impedance: $Z_C(s)=\frac{1}{sC}$

      \item From KVL:

        $$V_i(s)=I_i(s)R+I_i(s)R+I_i(s)Z_c(s)+V_o(s)$$
        $$V_i(s)=I_i(s)R+I_i(s)R+I_i(s)/sC+V_o(s)$$

      \item Substituting $I_i(s)=V_i(s)/R$:

        $$V_o(s)=-\frac{V_i(s)}{sRC}=-\frac{V_i(s)}{RC}\cdot\frac{1}{s}$$

      \item Taking the inverse Laplace transform, we get:

        $$v_o=-\frac{1}{RC}\int_0^t v_i\,dt$$

      \item Reset switch guarantees zero initial condition $V_c=0$ at $t=0$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Ideal Integrator Frequency Response

    \begin{itemize}

      \item We find the output-input ratio:

        $$\frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)}=-\frac{1}{j\omega RC}$$

      \item In practice:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Finite op-amp DC gain

          \item High-frequency op-amp gain roll-off

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Differentiator

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The output voltage expression can be derived with the same procedure as on the previous slides, but using the differentiation property of the Laplace transform:

        $$V_o(s)=-RC\frac{dV_i(s)}{dt}$$

      \item Alternatively, the output voltage equation can be derived directly by expressing the capacitor current as $i_c(t)=C\dfrac{dv_c(t)}{dt}$ (refer to the textbook for this approach)
        
    \end{itemize}

  \item Ideal Differentiatior Frequency Response

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $V_o(s)/V_i(s)=-j2\pi fRC$

      \item In practice:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Finite op-amp DC gain

          \item High-frequency op-amp gain roll-off

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Serious limitation for differentiators because they require high gain at high frequencies, which practical op-amps cannot achieve

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
