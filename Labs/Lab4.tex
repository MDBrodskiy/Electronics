\begin{abstract}

  The purpose of this laboratory experiment is to familiarize ourselves with bipolar junction transistor (BJT)-based amplifiers and the underlying concepts. This includes sensitivity to clipping, the frequency response of the gain, and the construction of a stable amplifier. This is all synthesized to then design a stable amplifier with high gain.

\section{Experimental Procedure}

We begin by constructing the following Common-Emitter Amplifier circuit:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Figures/L4C1}
  \caption{Common Emitter Amplifier with: $R_B=309[\si{\kilo\ohm}]$, $R_C=1[\si{\kilo\ohm}]$, $C_B=1.5[\si{\micro\farad}]$, $V^+=10[\si{\volt}]$, and $V_{in}=10[\si{\milli\volt}_{0p}]$}
  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

Physically, this looked like:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Figures/L4F1}
  \caption{Constructed Amplifier (Unstable)}
  \label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Confirming Active State}

Based on the parameters described in Figure \ref{fig:1}, we measure: $V_{CE}=2.75[\si{\volt}]$ and $V_{BE}=.715[\si{\volt}]$. Given that $V_{CE}>V_{BE}$, we conclude that the above amplifier is biased in the forward active region.

\subsection{Calculating Transconductance Gain}

We now calculate the collector current as:

$$I_C=\frac{V_{CE}-.7}{1k}$$
$$I_C=\frac{2.75-.7}{1k}$$
$$\boxed{I_C=2.05[\si{\milli\ampere}]}$$

Since we know that, at room temperature, $V_T=26[\si{\milli\ampere}]$, we may calculate:

$$g_m=\frac{2.05}{26}$$
$$\boxed{g_m=78.896[\si{\milli\siemen}]}$$

\subsection{Calculating the DC Gain ($\beta_{DC}$)}

We may experimentally determine the gain by finding:

$$I_B=\frac{.715-.7}{1k}$$
$$\boxed{I_B=15[\si{\micro\ampere}]}$$

Which gives us:

$$\beta_{DC}=\frac{I_C}{I_B}$$
$$\beta_{DC}=\frac{2.05}{.015}$$
$$\boxed{\beta_{DC}=136.67}$$

\subsection{Calculating $r_{\pi}$}

We may use our obtained values from above to find:

$$r_{\pi}=\frac{\beta}{g_m}$$
$$r_{\pi}=\frac{136.67}{.078846}$$
$$\boxed{r_{\pi}=1733.4[\si{\ohm}]}$$

\subsection{Calculating the Voltage Gain}

We may obtain the voltage gain using:

$$A_v=-g_mR_C$$
$$A_v=-(.078846)(1k)$$
$$\boxed{A_v=-78.846}$$

Note that the measured voltage gain was approximately $-80$, which is in line with the calculated gain.

\subsection{Experimentally Obtaining Voltage Gain}

Measuring the input voltage, we find that, zero-to-peak, it is a nominal $7[\si{\milli\volt}]$, while the output was $560[\si{\milli\volt}]$, and phase shifted by 180$^{\circ}$. This gives us an experimental gain of:

$$A_v=\frac{-560}{7}$$
$$\boxed{A_v=-80}$$

When $r_b=200[\si{\ohm}]$, the voltage gain meets a slight division, which gives us:

$$A_v=-g_m\left( \frac{r_{\pi}}{r_b+r_{\pi}} \right)$$
$$A_v=-(.78846)\left( \frac{1733.4}{200+1733.4} \right)$$
$$\boxed{A_v=-70.69}$$

We may observe that, in such a case, the voltage gain is slightly reduced.

\subsection{Output Clipping}

Experimentally, we observe clipping at $.15[\si{\volt}]$ and $0[\si{\volt}]$. We may explain the minimum because there is no negative voltage swing with the BJT. In the other hand, there is a maximum because the voltage gain times $.15[\si{\volt}]$ is greater than the supply voltage (as experienced with operational amplifiers).

\subsubsection{Gain Sensitivity to Supply Voltage}

Changing the supply voltage to $8[\si{\volt}]$, we see the voltage gain become:

$$A_v=-\frac{4.8}{.053}$$
$$\boxed{A_v=-90.566}$$

Changing the input to the $12[\si{\volt}]$, we see the gain magnitude increases to:

$$A_v=-\frac{5.6}{.047}$$
$$\boxed{A_v=-119.15}$$

We may determine that the amplifier is sensitive to changes in the supply voltage because the collector current depends on the collector-to-emitter voltage, and the collector-to-emitter voltage, in turn, depends on the supply voltage. Because the transconductance gain of the amplifier depends on the collector current, a change in the collector-to-emitter voltage results in a change in the gain, which depends on the transconductance gain.

\subsection{Frequency Response of the Gain}

We may observe that the upper corner frequency occurs at, approximately, $f_{crit}=730[\si{\kilo\hertz}]$. On the other hand, the lower corner frequency occurs at, approximately, $f_{crit}=14[\si{\kilo\hertz}]$. According to these values, though not ideal, this amplifier is best suited for an AM Radio. It can operate at a lower frequency by using a different capacitor value, which we observed by increasing the capacitance value.

\subsection{Stabilizing the Amplifier}

After introducing the changes to the amplifier, we see that the voltage gain is:

$$A_v=-4.7$$

and, thus, it is insensitive to changes in $V^+$. As expected, the gain decreased. Calculating the gain, we find that $A_v=-4$, which is just a bit lesser in magnitude than the value above. Introducing refrigerant increased the magnitude of the gain to $A_v=-21$, with the peak-to-peak output voltage going from $8.2\to8[\si{\volt}]$, and the input voltage remaining at $.44[\si{\volt}]$

\subsection{Constructing A Stable Amplifier}

With values derived in the pre-lab, we construct a stable amplifier as follows:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \include{Figures/L4C2}
  \caption{Stable BJT Amplifier}
  \label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

Physically, the circuit was constructed as shown below:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Figures/L4F2}
  \caption{Constructed Amplifier}
  \label{fig:4}
\end{figure}

The output for $V^{+}=8,10,$ and $12[\si{\volt}]$ is shown in Figures \ref{fig:5}-\ref{fig:7}:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Figures/L4F3}
  \caption{Stable Amplifier, $V^{+}=8[\si{\volt}]$}
  \label{fig:5}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Figures/L4F4}
  \caption{Stable Amplifier, $V^{+}=10[\si{\volt}]$}
  \label{fig:6}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Figures/L4F5}
  \caption{Stable Amplifier, $V^{+}=12[\si{\volt}]$}
  \label{fig:7}
\end{figure}

We may see that, though at a lower supply voltage there is slight clipping (which is to be expected), the amplifier meets the performance requirements.
