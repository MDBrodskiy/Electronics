\begin{enumerate}

  \item

  \item First, we know that $I_G=0$ since the input impedance of the MOSFET is high. In this manner, we may write:

    $$I_{DQ}=I_{SQ}$$

    Using KVL, we may obtain:

    $$V_{DD}=V_{GS}+I_{DQ}R_S$$
    $$V_{GS}=15-3000I_{DQ}$$

    Assuming the MOSFET is operating in the saturated region, we may write:

    $$I_{DQ}=K(V_{GS}-V_{to})^2$$
    $$I_{DQ}=.25(15-3000I_{DQ}-1)^2$$
    $$I_{DQ}=.25(14-3000I_{DQ})^2$$
    $$I_{DQ}=2250I_{DQ}^2-21I_{DQ}+.049$$
    $$0=2250I_{DQ}^2-22I_{DQ}+.049$$

    Solving the equation, we obtain:

    $$I_{DQ}=4.889\cdot10^{-3}\pm1.4572\cdot10^{-4}$$
    $$\boxed{I_{DQ}=6.3461,\,3.4317[\si{\milli\ampere}]}$$

    We now check the voltage in both cases. Let us use the first value to find the gate-to-source voltage:

    $$V_{GS1}=15-(3000)(I_{DQ})$$
    $$V_{GS1}=15-(3)(6.3461)$$
    $$\boxed{V_{GS1}=-4.0383[\si{\volt}]}$$

    We may observe that, in this case, the transistor is off. Now, we use the second value:

    $$V_{GS2}=15-(3000)(I_{DQ})$$
    $$V_{GS2}=15-(3)(3.4317)$$
    $$\boxed{V_{GS2}=4.7049[\si{\volt}]}$$

    We see that the transistor is on only for the second value. Thus, we proceed with the second drain current value. This gives us:

    $$V_{DD}-I_{DQ}(R_D)-V_{DSQ}-I_{DQ}(R_S)+V_{DD}=0$$
    $$30-I_{DQ}(R_D)-I_{DQ}(R_S)=V_{DSQ}$$

    We can solve using our known values:

    $$V_{DSQ}=30-3.4317(4)$$
    $$\boxed{V_{DSQ}=16.273[\si{\volt}]}$$

    We may observe that both $V_{GS}>V_{to}$ and $V_{DSQ}\geq V_{GS}-V_{to}$ are true, meaning that our saturation assumption was valid. As such, we have found our values for the given transistor.
