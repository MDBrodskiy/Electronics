\begin{itemize}

  \item PN-Junction Diodes

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Shockley Equation (``Diode Equation'')

        \begin{itemize}

          \item More realistic model for the I-V characteristics (for FB and RB regions)

          \item Based on semiconductor physics

            $$i_D=I_se^{V_D/(nV_T)}+1$$

        \end{itemize}

      \item $I_s$ is the saturation current ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-18}[\si{\ampere}]$)

      \item $n$ = diode ideality factor, also called emissions coefficient, and can range from 1 to 2

      \item $V_T=(kT)/q$ is the thermal voltage ($\approx26[\si{\milli\volt}]$ at $T=300[\si{\kelvin}]$ room temperature)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $k$ = Boltzmann's constant ($1.38\cdot10^{-23}[\si{\joule}/\si{\kelvin}]$), $q$ = electron charge ($1.6\cdot10^{-19}[\si{\coulomb}]$)

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Temperature Dependence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item At a constant current, the voltage drop decreases approximately $2[\si{\milli\volt}]$ for every $1[\si{\celsius}]$ increase in temperature

    \end{itemize}

  \item Solving Circuits using the Junction Diode Model

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Iterative Approach

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Pro: accurate hand calculations

          \item Con: tedious (time-consuming)

        \end{itemize}

      \item Graphical Approach

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Pro: fast

          \item Con: inaccurate (unless done numerically with a computer program)

        \end{itemize}

      \item Simulation

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Pro: most accurate

          \item Con: limited insights into the trade-offs

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
