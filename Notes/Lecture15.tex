  \item Digital Logic Fundamentals

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Analog Circuits

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Process ``real world signals'' like radio waves, sensor outputs, recorded speech, etc.

          \item Signal values can take on a continuous range

        \end{itemize}

      \item Digital Logic Circuits

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Binary Representation of Information

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Logical ``1'' (high, true, on)

              \item Logical ``0'' (low, false, off)

              \item Binary variables can represent real world information (\textit{e}.\textit{g}. open or closed switch, temperature ``or'', etc.)

            \end{itemize}

          \item Grouped variables (words) can represent quantized analog signals

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Example: $AB=0$ when $V_{sig}$ is $0-1[\si{\volt}]$, $AB=01$ when $V_{sig}$ is $1-2[\si{\volt}]$, and so on

              \item Bit: a single digit (``0'' or ``1'')

              \item Byte: a word with 8 bits

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Transition Times

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Finite rise/fall times are caused by RC delays

      \item $C_L$ depends on the fan-out

      \item Common timing specifications

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $t_r$ is the rise time (typically $10\%$ to $90\%$ of the difference)

          \item $t_f$ is the fall time (typically $90\%$ to $10\%$ of the difference)

          \item $t_{PLH}$ is the low-high propagation delay (50\% completed)

          \item $t_{PHL}$ is the high-low propagation delay (50\% completed)

          \item $t_{PD}=(t_{PLH}+t_{PHL})/2$ is the average propagation delay

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
