    Using the equation:

    $$i=I_s\left( e^{v/(nV_T)}-1 \right)$$

    and the given measurements, we may write:

    $$10^{-3}=I_s\left( e^{.62/(n.025)}-1 \right)$$
    $$10^{-2}=I_s\left( e^{.69/(n.025)}-1 \right)$$

    Since the exponential is greater than 1, we may simplify to:

    $$\frac{10^{-3}}{e^{24.8/n}}=I_s$$
    $$\frac{10^{-2}}{e^{27.6/n}}=I_s$$

    $$I_s=.001e^{-\frac{24.8}{n}}$$
    $$I_s=.01e^{-\frac{27.6}{n}}$$

    We can combine the two equations to solve for $n$ and $I_s$:

    $$.001e^{-\frac{24.8}{n}}=.01e^{-\frac{27.6}{n}}$$
    $$e^{-\frac{24.8}{n}}=10e^{-\frac{27.6}{n}}$$
    $$e^{\frac{27.6-24.8}{n}}=10$$
    $$\frac{27.6-24.8}{n}=\ln(10)$$
    $$n=\frac{2.8}{\ln(10)}$$
    $$\boxed{n=1.216}$$

    We then plug this into the earlier equations to find $I_s$:

    $$I_s=.001e^{-24.8/1.216}$$
    $$\boxed{I_s=1.3889\cdot10^{-12}[\si{\ampere}]}$$

    We can verify by using the second equation for $I_s$:

    $$I_s=.01e^{-27.6/1.216}$$
    $$\boxed{I_s=1.3889\cdot10^{-12}[\si{\ampere}]}$$

    It is difficult to measure the current in a reverse bias mode, however, because the diode may reach breakdown voltage by increasing the reverse voltage.
