\begin{itemize}

  \item Four-Resistor Bias Circuit

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Simplify using Th\'evenin Equivalent

    \end{itemize}

  \item DC Bias versus Small-Signal Parameters

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Superposition of DC and AC voltages/currents

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $V_{BEQ}, V_{CEQ},$ and $I_{CQ}$ define the DC operating point (or quiescent point of Q-point)

          \item $v_{be}$ is the small-signal (AC) input voltage

          \item $i_{c}$ is the small-signal (AC) collector current

          \item $v_{ce}$ is the small-signal (AC) collector-emitter voltage (the AC output voltage of this common-emitter amplitude)

          \item $v_{be}$ is the small-signal (AC) input voltage

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
