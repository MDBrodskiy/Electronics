  \item Review — Some Circuit Analysis Highlights

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Element combination rules (parallel, serial)

      \item Ohm's Law: $I=V/R$

      \item KVL for a circuit loop $\to \sum_jv_j=0$

      \item KCL at a node $\to\sum_ji_j=0$

      \item Superposition principle

        \begin{itemize}

          \item If input A produces response X and input B produces response Y, then input (A+B) produces response (X+Y)

          \item Holds only for linear circuits

          \item Very useful for circuits with multiple voltage and current sources

        \end{itemize}

      \item Th\'evenin and Norton form of signal sources

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Valid only in linear circuits

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Element Combination Rules

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Resistors in series can be summed ($R_1+R_2+\cdots+R_n=R_t$)

      \item Resistors in parallel can be summed via conductances $\left( G_x=\frac{1}{R_x}\right)$ can be combined to get $\to G_1+G_2+\cdots+G_n=G_t$

      \item Voltages in series can be summed ($V_1+V_2+\cdots+V_n=V_t$)

      \item Voltages in parallel will not occur, as it is illogical to place them in such a manner (and is the same reason current sources in series do not occur)

      \item Current sources in parallel may be summed ($i_1+i_2+\cdots+i_n=i_t$)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Analysis of Large Circuits

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Write all expressions for the circuit

        \begin{itemize}

          \item At elements (Ohm's Law)

          \item At nodes (KCL)

          \item For loops (KVL)

        \end{itemize}

      \item Eliminate redundant equations (keep only independent equations)

      \item Solve the system of equations for the unknown variables

    \end{itemize}

  \item Th\'evenin and Norton Equivalent Representations

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Th\'evenin to Norton transformation

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Set $I_s=V_s/R_s$ (short-circuit current), and $R_P=R_s$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Norton to Th\'evenin transformation

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Set $V_s=I_sR_s$ (open-circuit voltage), and $R_s=R_P$

          \end{itemize}

      \item In more complex cases, $R_s$ and $R_P$ are the equivalent resistances seen at terminals

    \end{itemize}

  \item A circuit can be broken into ``source'' components by assuming an open circuit for current sources, and short circuit for voltage sources

  \item This gives us components which we can then sum up via the superposition principle:

      \caption{Current Component}
      \label{fig:3}
    \end{figure}

  \item Amplification

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Voltage gain: $|A_v|$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item When $|A_v|$ is constant: linear amplifier

          \item When $|A_v|$ is not constant: non-linear amplifier

        \end{itemize}

      \item Non-inverting amplifier: $v_o(t)=A_vv_i(t)$

      \item Inverting amplifier: $v_o(t)=-A_vv_i(t)$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Voltage-Amplifier Model

    \begin{itemize}

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Images/VAM.png}
          \caption{Reference Figure for the Voltage-Amplifier Model}
          \label{fig:4}
        \end{figure}

      \item Parameters

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $v_s$ is the input voltage source, which has a series resistance $R_s$

          \item $R_i$ and $R_o$ are the input and output resistances, respectively

          \item $A_{vo}$ is the open-circuit voltage gain

          \item $R_L$ is the load resistance

        \end{itemize}

      \item Remember: This is a simplified representation of an amplifier

      \item Current gain: $A_i=\dfrac{i_o}{i_i}=\dfrac{(v_o/R_L)}{(v_i/R_i)}=A_v(R_i/R_L)$

      \item Loaded voltage gain: $A_v=\dfrac{v_o}{v_i}\neq A_{vo}$

      \item Power gain: $G=\dfrac{P_o}{P_i}=\underbrace{\dfrac{V_oI_o}{V_iI_i}}_{\text{RMS}}=A_vA_i=A_v^2\cdot\dfrac{R_i}{R_L}$

      \item For optimum voltage transfer, $R_L>>R_o$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Loading Effects

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Refer to the same figure (Figure \ref{fig:4}) as for the Voltage-Amplifier Mode

      \item Input signal attentuation: $v_i=v_s\left( \dfrac{R_i}{R_i+R_s} \right)$

      \item Output signal attentuation: $v_o=A_{vo}v_i\left( \dfrac{R_L}{R_L+R_o} \right)$

      \item Loaded voltage gain of the amplifier: $A_v=\dfrac{v_o}{v_i}=A_{vo}\left( \dfrac{R_L}{R_L+R_o} \right)$

      \item Voltage gain from source to load $A_{vs}=\frac{v_o}{v_s}=A_{vo}\left( \dfrac{R_i}{R_i+R_s} \right)\left( \dfrac{R_L}{R_L+R_o} \right)$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Decibel Notation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Use $20\log(X)$ for voltages and currents

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $A_{v\text{dB}}=20\log(|A_v|)$

          \item $A_{i\text{dB}}=20\log(|A_i|)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Use $10\log(X)$ for powers

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $G_{\text{dB}}=10\log(|G|)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Quantities in decibels are added when two or more amplifiers are connected in series (called ``cascaded'')

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
