  \item
    
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We may begin by saying that $V_{gs}(t)$ may be expressed as:

        $$V_{gs}(t)=V_{g}(t)-V_{s}(t)$$

        We may see that the source voltage is grounded, which lets us say:

        $$V_{gs}(t)=V_{g}(t)$$

        We may see that, taking the capacitor as a short, the voltage at $G$ is simply the sum of the input voltage and the divided voltage from the $20[\si{\volt}]$ supply voltage. Thus, we may write:

        $$V_g(t)=\frac{300k(20)}{300k+1700k}+V_i$$
        $$V_g(t)=3+\sin(2000\pi t)$$

        Thus, we may say:

        $$\boxed{V_{gs}(t)=3+\sin(2000\pi t)}$$

      \item Parts (b-d) are combined in the plot shown in (d)

      \item Parts (b-d) are combined in the plot shown in (d)

      \item We may generate the following plot:

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/HW11-1}
          \caption{Plot for Parts (b)-(d)}
          \label{fig:1}
        \end{figure}

        We may observe, first and foremost, that the curve is zero for $V_{gs}=1[\si{\volt}]$, since, at this value, $V_{gs}=V_{to}$. We may observe via the load line in the plot that $V_{ds}\approx16[\si{\volt}]$ at the $Q$-point, and $V_{ds}^{max}\approx20[\si{\volt}]$ and $V_{ds}^{min}\approx10[\si{\volt}]$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We may observe that $V_1$ may be obtained using our equations:

        $$I_D=\frac{\mu_pC_{ox}W}{2L}[V_{GS}-|V_{t}|]^2$$
        $$8=.5[V_{GS}-|-1|]^2$$
        $$V_{GS}^2-2V_{GS}+1=16$$
        $$V_{GS}^2-2V_{GS}-15=0$$

        We see that the two solutions are $V_{GS}=5,-3[\si{\volt}]$. We know the value is positive, so we write:

        $$V_S-V_G=5$$
        $$V_G=V_S-5$$
        $$V_G=10-5$$
        $$\boxed{V_1=V_G=5[\si{\volt}]}$$

        We may then proceed to calculate the voltage using the current source, which is equal to $I_D$, at $V_2$, which we may find as:

        $$V_2=-10+8(.5)$$
        $$\boxed{V_2=-6[\si{\volt}]}$$

      \item From the figure, we may observe:

        $$V_3=V_{G1}$$
        $$V_S=15[\si{\volt}]$$

        We may use our formulas to write:

        $$I_D=\frac{\mu_p C_{ox}W}{2L}[V_{SG1}-|V_t|]^2$$

        Looking at the current source at the end, we see that $I_D=8[\si{\milli\ampere}]$. This lets us get:

        $$8=(.5)[V_{SG1}-|-1|]^2$$

        This lets us get (simplifying $V_{SG1}\to V$):

        $$V^2-2V+1=16$$
        $$V^2-2V-15=0$$
        $$(V-5)(V+3)=0$$
        $$V_{SG1}=5,-3$$

        We proceed with the positive value, which gives us:

        $$5=V_S-V_{G1}$$
        $$V_s-5=V_{G1}$$
        $$V_{G1}=15-5$$

        And finally:

        $$\boxed{V_3=V_{G1}=10[\si{\volt}]}$$

        We then use the same method to get $V_4=V_{G2}$:

        $$8=(.5)[V_{SG2}-|-1|]^2$$

        To simplify, take $V=V_{SG2}$:

        $$V^2-2V+1=16$$
        $$V=5,-3$$

        Again, we proceed with the positive value to get:

        $$V_{S}-V_{G2}=5$$
        $$V_{G2}=V_S-5$$
        $$V_{G2}=10-5$$

        This gets us:

        $$\boxed{V_4=V_{G2}=5[\si{\volt}]}$$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Taking the capacitors as open circuits, we end up with a circuit consisting solely of the $15[\si{\volt}]$ DC source, the NMOS, and the $10[\si{\mega\ohm}]$, $5[\si{\mega\ohm}]$, $7.5[\si{\kilo\ohm}]$, and $3[\si{\kilo\ohm}]$ resistors. This allows us to divide the voltage to find $V_G$:

        $$V_G=(V_{DC})\frac{5}{10+5}$$
        $$\boxed{V_G=5[\si{\volt}]}$$

        The drain current may be found as:

        $$I_D=\frac{V_S}{R_S}$$

        Alternatively, we may write:

        $$I_D=\frac{V_G-V_{GS}}{R_S}$$

        We can then equate this to our formula:

        $$I_D=K(V_{GS}-V_t)^2$$

        This gets us:

        $$V_{GS}^2-2V_{GS}+1=\frac{5-V_{GS}}{3}$$
        $$V_{GS}^2-\frac{5}{3}V_{GS}-\frac{2}{3}=$$
        $$V_{GS}=\frac{(5/3)\pm\sqrt{(25/9)-(4)(1)(-2/3)}}{2}$$
        $$V_{GS}=\frac{(5/3)\pm(7/3)}{2}$$
        $$V_{GS}=2,-\frac{1}{3}$$

        We proceed with the positive value:

        $$I_D=\frac{5-2}{3}[\si{\milli\ampere}]$$
        $$\boxed{I_D=1[\si{\milli\ampere}]}$$

        We may find the transconductance gain to get:

        $$g_m=\frac{2I_D}{V_{GS}-V_t}$$
        $$g_m=\frac{2(.001)}{2-1}$$
        $$\boxed{g_m=2[\si{\milli S}]}$$

        We can obtain:

        $$r_{ds}=\frac{V_A}{I_D}$$
        $$r_{ds}=\frac{100}{10^{-3}}$$
        $$\boxed{r_{ds}=100[\si{\kilo\ohm}]}$$

      \item 

      \item For the common source state, we know that $\boxed{Z_{in}\to\infty}$
